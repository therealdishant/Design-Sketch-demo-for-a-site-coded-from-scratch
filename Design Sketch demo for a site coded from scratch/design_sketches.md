- Desktop view (800px and above):
  - Header with logo and navigation in a horizontal layout
  - Main content area with a 2:1 ratio between content and sidebar
  - Sidebar visible on the right side
  - Footer spanning full width

- Mobile view (below 800px):
  - Stacked header with logo above navigation
  - Full-width content sections
  - Sidebar hidden to prioritize main content
  - Footer remains full width

### Key Features
